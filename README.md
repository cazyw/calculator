# Calculator App
Free Code Camp Intermediate Project - Jacascript Calculator App

## Objective and Discussion

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/.

1. I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
2. I can clear the input field with a clear button.
3. I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

**Status:** a work in progress (current project)
